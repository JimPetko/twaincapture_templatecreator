# TwainCapture_TemplateCreator

.NET Framework 4.8 WinForms Application which allows Dental professionals to create .xml files which are interpreted by Digital Doc's TwainCapture application. When parsed, TwainCapture will allow users to acquire images into pre-defined mounts.

Automatically rotates, mirrors, and flips images to use dental industry standards.
XML files are created in the same directory as the  TwainCapture_TemplateCreator executable. When added into the Blu Sensor installer, this application will reside @"%Program Files (X86)%\Digital Doc\TwainCapture\Templates"
